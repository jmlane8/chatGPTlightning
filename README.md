This project contains a Java implementation of a Python program I wrote to model the propagation of thunder through the standard atmosphere.
Refraction index is based on the ratio of speed of sound at different levels. The speed of sound was calculated from temperature, pressure and humidity.
Points are calculate from the result angle from refraction index.

The result shows beyond a distance, the thunder doesn't reach the ground.

Original code is here.

I entered "convert the following python program to java" with the python program into ChatGPT.
Part of the first response is contained in Main1_java.txt

The full text of "regenerate response" (the second try) is in src/Main.java.
